# Logistics Optimization Using SQL

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on optimizing delivery routes and analyzing logistics performance
using SQL queries on an e-commerce delivery dataset.

## Datasets
- Contains delivery records including city, delivery time, distance, and order volume
- Dataset size: 10,000+ records

## Tools & Technologies
- SQL (MySQL)
- Advanced SQL (CTEs, Subqueries, Window Functions)

##  Key Analysis Performed
- Delivery time analysis by city
- Identification of delayed shipments
- Performance ranking using window functions
- Bottleneck detection using aggregations

## Key Insights
- Certain cities consistently show higher delivery delays
- Optimized queries help identify inefficient routes
